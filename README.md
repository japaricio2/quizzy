 # Quizzy
 
Quizzy is a web application that makes it easy to create custom and anonymous quizzes. I thought it would be fun to share quizzes with your friends, or use it as an educational tool. Test yourself, your friends, or just have fun sharing pointless quizzes.

Quizzy has a dashboard that lets you update, edit, and maintain your quizzes. It also features a dashboard to see how people have scored on your quiz.
